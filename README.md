# CSharp-Web-September-2017

## This repository keeps my work during the third C# module in SoftUni.

- 01. C# Web Development Basics - keeps the solutions for the first part of the course. The exam preparations and the final exam represent building a simple application with MVC design pattern without using ASP.NET MVC framework. We are using simple web server and simple MVC framework which we built from scratch during the exercises.
