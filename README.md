# CSharp-Web-September-2017

## Repository about C# Web module in SoftUni.

- C# Web Development Basics - all the exercises and exams which I have done during the first part of the course. The exam preparations and the final exam represent building a simple web application with MVC design pattern without using ASP.NET MVC framework. We are using simple web server and simple MVC framework which we built from scratch during the exercises.
