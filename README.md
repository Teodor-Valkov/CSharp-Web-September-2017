# CSharp-Web-September-2017

## Repository about C# Web module in Software University.

- C# Web Development Basics - all the exercises and exams which I have done during the first part of the course. The exam preparations and the final exam represent building a simple web application with MVC design pattern without using ASP.NET MVC framework. We are using simple web server and simple MVC framework which we built from scratch during the exercises.

- C# Web Development Advanced - all the exercises which I have done during the second part of the course. The exercises represent building different web applications from scratch using MVC design pattern with Entity Framework CORE and ASP.NET MVC CORE.

- Fit Store - my final individual practical project for this course. It is created with ASP.NET MVC Core and Entity Framework Core. The application represents an online web store in which the users can register and login in order to comment, review and buy products separated in different categories and subcategories. In the project are implemented different user roles and areas separated in private sections for admins, store managers, moderators and regular users. Depending on its role every user can access different sections of the application and has specific permissions of what can or cannot do.
